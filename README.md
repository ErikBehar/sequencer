Unity3D Sequencer Tool
=========

This tool can be used to create lists of commands to
run from top to bottom. The flow of the commands
can be changed depending on choice or jump commands.

It can be used to make visual novels or motion graphic books
or game dialogs, or anything else you can think of.

Key Features: 

* Commands can be played forward & backwards (rewind)
* Import whole Ren'py visual novels into unity
* You can have really long lists of commands
* Can be used for 2D or 3D
* you can use variables and small logic expressions
* export & import
* Easy to add your own commands or modify the ui, has
  uGUI and nGUI examples

 This project uses two other free projects:
 DOTween : http://dotween.demigiant.com/  (used for moving characters and volumes)
 TinyExe : https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/241830/a-Tiny-Expression-Evaluator  (used for evaluating expressions w/ variables) 
 I have included them in the repo for quick bootstrapping, but there might be newer versions available at their respective creators sites.
